# Inventory Management System API

This is a Python microservice created using FastAPI that provides a REST API for the Inventory Management System.

## How to Run

This microservice requires a MongoDB instance to run against.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed (if you want to run the microservice inside Docker)
- Python 3.13 and MongoDB 7.0 installed on your machine (if you are not using Docker)
- Public key (must be OpenSSH encoded) to decode JWT access tokens (if JWT authentication/authorization is enabled)
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) installed (if you want to interact with the database using
  a GUI)
- This repository cloned

### Prerequisite Steps

1. Create a `.env` file alongside the `.env.example` file. Use the example file as a reference and modify the values
   accordingly.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Create a `logging.ini` file alongside the `logging.example.ini` file. Use the example file as a reference and modify
   it accordingly:

   ```bash
   cp logging.example.ini logging.ini
   ```

3. (**Required only if JWT Auth is enabled**) Inside the keys directory in the root of the project directory, create a
   copy of the public key generated by the authentication component. This is needed for decoding of JWT access tokens
   signed by the corresponding private key.

### Inside of Docker

Ensure that Docker is installed and running on your machine before proceeding.

#### Using `docker-compose.yml` for local development

The easiest way to run the application with Docker for local development is using the `docker-compose.yml` file. It is
configured to start

- A MongoDB instance that can be accessed at `localhost:27017` using `root` as the username and
  `example` as the password
- The application in a reload mode which using the mounted `inventory_management_system_api` directory means that
  FastAPI will watch for changes made to the code and automatically reload the application on the fly.

1. Build and start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   The microservice should now be running inside Docker at http://localhost:8000 and its Swagger UI could be accessed
   at http://localhost:8000/docs. A MongoDB instance should also be running at http://localhost:27017.

2. Follow the [post setup instructions](#post-setup-instructions).

#### Using `Dockerfile` for local development

Use the `Dockerfile`'s `dev` stage to run just the application itself in a container. Use this only for local
development (not production)! Mounting the `inventory_management_system_api` directory to the container via a volume
means that FastAPI will watch for changes made to the code and automatically reload the application on the fly. The
application requires a MongoDB instance to run against and one can be started using the `docker-compose.yml` file.

1. Start a MongoDB instance:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --detach mongo-db
   ```

2. Build an image using the `Dockerfile`'s dev stage from the root of the project directory:

   ```bash
   docker build --file Dockerfile --target dev --tag inventory-management-system-api:dev .
   ```

3. Start the container using the image built and map it to port `8000` locally (please note that the public key volume
   is only needed if JWT Auth is enabled):

   ```bash
   docker run \
    --publish 8000:8000 \
    --name inventory-management-system-api \
    --network host \
    --env-file ./.env \
    --volume ./inventory_management_system_api:/app/inventory_management_system_api \
    --volume ./keys/jwt-key.pub:/app/keys/jwt-key.pub \
    --volume ./logging.ini:/app/logging.ini \
    inventory-management-system-api:dev
   ```

   The microservice should now be running inside Docker at http://localhost:8000 and its Swagger UI could be accessed
   at http://localhost:8000/docs.

4. Follow the [post setup instructions](#post-setup-instructions)

#### Using `Dockerfile` for running all the tests

Use the `Dockerfile`'s `test` stage to run all the tests in a container. Mounting the `inventory_management_system_api`
and `test` directories to the container via volumes means that any changes made to the application or test code will
automatically be synced to the container next time you run the tests. The e2e tests require a MongoDB instance to run,
and one can be started using the `docker-compose.yml` file.

1. Start a MongoDB instance:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --detach mongo-db
   ```

2. Build an image using the `Dockerfile`'s `test` stage from the root of the project directory:

   ```bash
   docker build --file Dockerfile --target test --tag inventory-management-system-api:test .
   ```

3. Run the tests using:

   ```bash
   docker run \
    --rm \
    --name inventory-management-system-api-test \
    --network host \
    --volume ./inventory_management_system_api:/app/inventory_management_system_api \
    --volume ./test:/app/test \
    --volume ./logging.ini:/app/logging.ini \
    inventory-management-system-api:test
   ```

#### Using `Dockerfile` for running the unit tests

Use the `Dockerfile`'s `test` stage to run the unit tests in a container. Mounting the `inventory_management_system_api`
and `test` directories to the container via volumes means that any changes made to the application or test code will
automatically be synced to the container next time you run the tests.

1. Build an image using the `Dockerfile`'s `test` stage from the root of the project directory:

   ```bash
   docker build --file Dockerfile --target test --tag inventory-management-system-api:test .
   ```

2. Run the tests using:

   ```bash
   docker run \
    --rm \
    --name inventory-management-system-api-test \
    --volume ./inventory_management_system_api:/app/inventory_management_system_api \
    --volume ./test:/app/test \
    --volume ./logging.ini:/app/logging.ini \
    inventory-management-system-api:test \
    pytest --config-file test/pytest.ini --cov inventory_management_system_api --cov-report term-missing test/unit -v
   ```

#### Using `Dockerfile` for running the e2e tests

Use the `Dockerfile`'s `test` stage to run the e2e tests in a container. Mounting the `inventory_management_system_api`
and `test` directories to the container via volumes means that any changes made to the application or test code will
automatically be synced to the container next time you run the tests. The e2e tests require a MongoDB instance to run,
and one can be started using the `docker-compose.yml` file.

1. Start a MongoDB instance:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --detach mongo-db
   ```

2. Build an image using the `Dockerfile`'s `test` stage from the root of the project directory:

   ```bash
   docker build --file Dockerfile --target test --tag inventory-management-system-api:test .
   ```

3. Run the tests using:

   ```bash
   docker run \
    --rm \
    --name inventory-management-system-api-test \
    --network host \
    --volume ./inventory_management_system_api:/app/inventory_management_system_api \
    --volume ./test:/app/test \
    --volume ./logging.ini:/app/logging.ini \
    inventory-management-system-api:test \
    pytest --config-file test/pytest.ini test/e2e -v
   ```

### Outside of Docker

#### Prerequisites

- You must have access to a MongoDB instance with at least one replica set.

#### Running the API

Ensure that Python is installed on your machine before proceeding.

1. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it in the root of the project directory:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install .[dev]
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the application

   ```bash
   fastapi dev inventory_management_system_api/main.py
   ```

   The microservice should now be running locally at http://localhost:8000. The Swagger UI can be accessed
   at http://localhost:8000/docs.

4. Follow the [post setup instructions](#post-setup-instructions)

5. To run the unit tests, run :

   ```bash
   pytest -c test/pytest.ini test/unit/
   ```

6. To run the e2e tests, run:

   ```bash
   pytest -c test/pytest.ini test/e2e/
   ```

7. To run all the tests, run:

   ```bash
   pytest -c test/pytest.ini test/
   ```

## Post setup instructions

### Setting up the database [**Only if not using docker**]

#### Initialising the replica set

For development replica sets are required to be able to use transactions. To set up for use with a single replica set
you should first generate a keyfile to use e.g.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 756 > /etc/mongodb/keys/rs_keyfile
chmod 0400 /etc/mongodb/keys/rs_keyfile
sudo chown 999:999 /etc/mongodb/keys/rs_keyfile
```

Then when starting the MongoDB instance you must ensure you also use the options found below

```bash
mongod --replSet rs0 --keyFile /etc/mongodb/keys/rs_keyfile
```

Once the MongoDB instance is running use `mongosh` to login and run

```bash
rs.initiate( {
   _id : "rs0",
   members: [
      { _id: 0, host: "<hostname>:27017" }
   ]
})
```

replacing `<hostname>` with the actual hostname for the replica set.

### Using mock data for testing [Optional]

#### Populating the database

The simplest way to populate the database with mock data is to use the already created database dump. If using docker
for development you may use

```bash
python ./scripts/dev_cli.py db-import
```

to populate the database with mock data.

If you wish to do this manually the full command is

```bash
docker exec -i ims-api-mongodb mongorestore --username "root" --password "example" --authenticationDatabase=admin --db ims --archive < ./data/mock_data.dump
```

Otherwise, there is a script to generate mock data for testing purposes given in `./scripts/generate_mock_data.py`. To
use it from your development environment first ensure the API is running and then execute it with

```bash
python ./scripts/generate_mock_data.py
```

## Generating new mock data

The easiest way to generate new mock data assuming you are using Linux is via the dev_cli script. To do this use

```bash
python ./scripts/dev_cli.py db-generate
```

This will clear the database, import the default data e.g. units and then generate mock data. If
the `generate_mock_data.py` script is changed, or if there are database model changes please use

```bash
python ./scripts/dev_cli.py db-generate -d
```

to update the `./data/mock_data.dump` file and commit the changes.

### Manually

The parameters at the top of the `generate_mock_data.py` file can be used to change the generated data. NOTE: This
script will simply add to the existing database instance. So if you wish to update the `mock_data.dump`, you should
first clear the database e.g. using

```bash
docker exec -i ims-api-mongodb mongosh ims --username "root" --password "example" --authenticationDatabase=admin --eval "db.dropDatabase()"
```

Then generate the mock data using

```bash
python ./scripts/generate_mock_data.py
```

and then update the `./data/mock_data.dump` file using `mongodump` via

```bash
docker exec -i ims-api-mongodb mongodump --username "root" --password "example" --authenticationDatabase=admin --db ims --archive > ./data/mock_data.dump
```

## Notes

### Application Configuration

The configuration for the application is handled
using [Pydantic Settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/). It allows for loading config
values from environment variables or the `.env` file. Please note that even when using the `.env` file, Pydantic will
still read environment variables as well as the `.env` file, environment variables will always take priority over
values loaded from the `.env` file.

Listed below are the environment variables supported by the application.

| Environment Variable                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Mandatory                 | Default Value                                         |

### JWT Authentication/Authorization

This microservice supports JWT authentication/authorization and this can be enabled or disabled by setting
the `AUTHENTICATION__ENABLED` environment variable to `True` or `False`. When enabled, all the endpoints require a JWT
access token to be supplied. This ensures that only authenticated and authorized users can access the resources. To
decode the JWT access token, the application needs the public key that corresponding to the private key used for
encoding the token. Once the JWT access token is decoded successfully, it checks that it has a `username` in the
payload, and it has not expired. This means that any microservice can be used to generate JWT access tokens so long as
it meets the above criteria. The [LDAP-JWT Authentication Service](https://github.com/ral-facilities/ldap-jwt-auth) is
a microservice that provides user authentication against an LDAP server and returns a JWT access token.

### Migrations

#### Adding a migration

To add a migration first use

```bash
ims-migrate create <migration_name> <migration_description>
```

to create a new one inside the `inventory_management_system/migrations/scripts` directory. Then add the code necessary
to perform the migration. See `_example_migration.py` for an example on how to implement one.

#### Performing forward migrations

Before performing a migration you can first check the current status of the database and any outstanding migrations
using

```bash
ims-migrate status
```

or in Docker

```bash
docker exec -it inventory-management-system-api ims-migrate status
```

Then to perform all outstanding migrations up to the latest one use

```bash
ims-migrate forward latest
```

You may also specify a specific migration name to apply instead which will apply all migrations between the current
applied one and the specified one. A prompt will be shown to ensure the migrations being applied are sensible.

#### Performing backward migrations

To revert the database by performing backwards migrations you can first use

```bash
ims-migrate status
```

to check the current status of the database and available migrations and then use

```bash
ims-migrate backward <migration_name>
```

to perform all backward migrations to get from the current database state back to the state prior to the chosen
migration name (i.e. it also performs the backward migration for the given migration name).

#### Forcing migration state

If for some reason the migration state is different to what you expect it may be forced via

```bash
ims-migrate set <migration_name>
```

This is already set to `latest` automatically when using the `dev_cli` to regenerate mock data so that the dump retains
the expected state.
